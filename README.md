# Project name:
A Minimalistic Journey

# Description:
A Minimalistic Journey, is a 2D Platformer game, created with Unity using C#.
The main objective of the game is to reach the end of the levels without losing your 3 Lives, or you'll have to start all over.
As a genre, the game is a Fast-Paced Rage Game, after losing all the lives, good luck, you can say "Here we go again...!"

# Download/Installation:
The game can be downloaded directly from this repository and doesn't need any installation, can be opened from the Game folder.

# Scripts:
Throughout the game, I've created multiple scripts that can maintain collectibles, counters, shooting, physics and so on.

That's it for my first project.
Looking more into the future for more, exciting... inovative... majestic... projects!
It's been a pleasure... doing business with you!
